## Gmail SMTP Configuration

SyncServe uses Gmail SMTP for sending emails. Follow these steps to set up your email credentials:

### Step 1: Generate Gmail App Password
1. Visit [Google Account Security](https://myaccount.google.com/security)
2. If not already enabled:
   - Enable 2-Step Verification
   - Go to "Security" â†’ "2-Step Verification" and follow the setup process
3. Generate App Password:
   - Go to [App Passwords](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords)
   - Type app name (e.g. "SyncServe")
   - Click "Create"
   - Copy the 16-character password

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The app password is not the same as your email password that you use to login. It is a token generated by google per app.

### Step 2: Update Environment File
Update your `.env` file with your Gmail credentials:
```env
SMTP_USERNAME=your.email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASSWORD=your_16_character_app_password
```

### Troubleshooting
- Make sure 2-Step Verification is enabled before trying to create an App Password
- If emails fail to send, verify that:
  - Your App Password is correctly copied (16 characters with no spaces)
  - Your Gmail account doesn't have any security blocks
  - The SMTP settings in the application match Gmail's requirements (port 587, SSL disabled)

### Security Notes
- Never commit your `.env` file to version control
- Regularly rotate your App Password for security
- Keep your App Password secure - anyone with this password can send emails through your account
